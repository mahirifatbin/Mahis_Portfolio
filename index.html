            <h3>A Researcher, Traveller, Vloger, Comedian and Lazy King</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As a Researcher I use various methodologies to conduct my research, including collating sources such as
                internet searchers, journals and other publications. I often work as specialists in machine learning
                research, medical image processing, scientific research or in public problem solutions. Besides I would
                love
                to make video content for instance Travelling vlog or other comedy shows. Im the only one who always
                love to
                keep watching his dream but in reality there is nothing left for me. Because dream wont come to me due
                to my
                laziness.

            <h3>On Wedding Day
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Life will follow its own way to achieve it or loose it. I have had a dream that I will marry whome I
                love most and I did it. Our journey was nearly 7 years old. Withing these days we fought, again came
                back, enjoying, crying but never let us down to the earth. It was tough story of myself to move China
                and finished my study which actually didnt help me now but she thought I have changed my own soul. I
                dont know, maybe Im being depressed or overthinking kills me. I cant express my feelings like before.
                Whatever I love her and care for her same as before. I always trying to make her happy at any chance.
                Forgive if I did any mistake. You shouted with me last night, which make me disappointed. Whatever I
                love you Rafa.
